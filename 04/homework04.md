## Module 4 Homework

### Question 1: Understanding dbt model resolution

Provided you've got the following sources.yaml
```yaml
version: 2

sources:
  - name: raw_nyc_tripdata
    database: "{{ env_var('DBT_BIGQUERY_PROJECT', 'dtc_zoomcamp_2025') }}"
    schema:   "{{ env_var('DBT_BIGQUERY_SOURCE_DATASET', 'raw_nyc_tripdata') }}"
    tables:
      - name: ext_green_taxi
      - name: ext_yellow_taxi
```

with the following env variables setup where `dbt` runs:
```shell
export DBT_BIGQUERY_PROJECT=myproject
export DBT_BIGQUERY_DATASET=my_nyc_tripdata
```

What does this .sql model compile to?
```sql
select * 
from {{ source('raw_nyc_tripdata', 'ext_green_taxi' ) }}
```

- `select * from dtc_zoomcamp_2025.raw_nyc_tripdata.ext_green_taxi`
- `select * from dtc_zoomcamp_2025.my_nyc_tripdata.ext_green_taxi`
- **`select * from myproject.raw_nyc_tripdata.ext_green_taxi`**
- `select * from myproject.my_nyc_tripdata.ext_green_taxi`
- `select * from dtc_zoomcamp_2025.raw_nyc_tripdata.green_taxi`

#### Answer :
`
select * from myproject.raw_nyc_tripdata.ext_green_taxi
`



### Question 2: dbt Variables & Dynamic Models

Say you have to modify the following dbt_model (`fct_recent_taxi_trips.sql`) to enable Analytics Engineers to dynamically control the date range. 

- In development, you want to process only **the last 7 days of trips**
- In production, you need to process **the last 30 days** for analytics

```sql
select *
from {{ ref('fact_taxi_trips') }}
where pickup_datetime >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30' DAY
```

What would you change to accomplish that in a such way that command line arguments takes precedence over ENV_VARs, which takes precedence over DEFAULT value?

- Add `ORDER BY pickup_datetime DESC` and `LIMIT {{ var("days_back", 30) }}`
- Update the WHERE clause to `pickup_datetime >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '{{ var("days_back", 30) }}' DAY`
- Update the WHERE clause to `pickup_datetime >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '{{ env_var("DAYS_BACK", "30") }}' DAY`
- **Update the WHERE clause to `pickup_datetime >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '{{ var("days_back", env_var("DAYS_BACK", "30")) }}' DAY`**
- Update the WHERE clause to `pickup_datetime >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '{{ env_var("DAYS_BACK", var("days_back", "30")) }}' DAY`

#### Answer :
Update the WHERE clause to 
`
pickup_datetime >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '{{ var("days_back", env_var("DAYS_BACK", "30")) }}'
`DAY

The var() function first checks for values passed via command-line arguments, which have the highest priority. If no command-line argument is provided, it falls back to the environment variable using env_var().If neither is available, it defaults to 30 days



### Question 3: dbt Data Lineage and Execution

Considering the data lineage below **and** that taxi_zone_lookup is the **only** materialization build (from a .csv seed file):

![image](./homework_q2.png)

Select the option that does **NOT** apply for materializing `fct_taxi_monthly_zone_revenue`:

- `dbt run`
- `dbt run --select +models/core/dim_taxi_trips.sql+ --target prod`
- `dbt run --select +models/core/fct_taxi_monthly_zone_revenue.sql`
- `dbt run --select +models/core/`
- **`dbt run --select models/staging/+`**

#### Answer :
`dbt run --select models/staging/+` This will only run for the staging directory and not the core.



### Question 4: dbt Macros and Jinja

Consider you're dealing with sensitive data (e.g.: [PII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_data)), that is **only available to your team and very selected few individuals**, in the `raw layer` of your DWH (e.g: a specific BigQuery dataset or PostgreSQL schema), 

 - Among other things, you decide to obfuscate/masquerade that data through your staging models, and make it available in a different schema (a `staging layer`) for other Data/Analytics Engineers to explore

- And **optionally**, yet  another layer (`service layer`), where you'll build your dimension (`dim_`) and fact (`fct_`) tables (assuming the [Star Schema dimensional modeling](https://www.databricks.com/glossary/star-schema)) for Dashboarding and for Tech Product Owners/Managers

You decide to make a macro to wrap a logic around it:

```sql
{% macro resolve_schema_for(model_type) -%}

    {%- set target_env_var = 'DBT_BIGQUERY_TARGET_DATASET'  -%}
    {%- set stging_env_var = 'DBT_BIGQUERY_STAGING_DATASET' -%}

    {%- if model_type == 'core' -%} {{- env_var(target_env_var) -}}
    {%- else -%}                    {{- env_var(stging_env_var, env_var(target_env_var)) -}}
    {%- endif -%}

{%- endmacro %}
```

And use on your staging, dim_ and fact_ models as:
```sql
{{ config(
    schema=resolve_schema_for('core'), 
) }}
```

That all being said, regarding macro above, **select all statements that are true to the models using it**:
- **Setting a value for  `DBT_BIGQUERY_TARGET_DATASET` env var is mandatory, or it'll fail to compile**
- Setting a value for `DBT_BIGQUERY_STAGING_DATASET` env var is mandatory, or it'll fail to compile
- **When using `core`, it materializes in the dataset defined in `DBT_BIGQUERY_TARGET_DATASET`**
- **When using `stg`, it materializes in the dataset defined in `DBT_BIGQUERY_STAGING_DATASET`, or defaults to `DBT_BIGQUERY_TARGET_DATASET`**
- **When using `staging`, it materializes in the dataset defined in `DBT_BIGQUERY_STAGING_DATASET`, or defaults to `DBT_BIGQUERY_TARGET_DATASET`**

#### Answer :

1. Setting a value for `DBT_BIGQUERY_TARGET_DATASET` env var is mandatory, or it'll fail to compile 

   This variable is always accessed by the macro, either directly or as a fallback. If it is not set, the macro will fail to compile.  

2. Setting a value for `DBT_BIGQUERY_STAGING_DATASET` env var is mandatory, or it'll fail to compile 

   **False**: This variable is optional because the macro uses `DBT_BIGQUERY_TARGET_DATASET` as a fallback if it is not provided.  

3. When using `core`, it materializes in the dataset defined in `DBT_BIGQUERY_TARGET_DATASET`

   If the `model_type` is `'core'`, the macro directly returns `DBT_BIGQUERY_TARGET_DATASET`.  

4. When using `stg`, it materializes in the dataset defined in `DBT_BIGQUERY_STAGING_DATASET`, or defaults to `DBT_BIGQUERY_TARGET_DATASET`

   For any model type other than `'core'`, the macro first checks `DBT_BIGQUERY_STAGING_DATASET`. If it is not set, it defaults to `DBT_BIGQUERY_TARGET_DATASET`.  

5. When using `staging`, it materializes in the dataset defined in `DBT_BIGQUERY_STAGING_DATASET`, or defaults to `DBT_BIGQUERY_TARGET_DATASET`
 
   The same logic applies here as for `'stg'`. The macro prioritizes `DBT_BIGQUERY_STAGING_DATASET` and falls back to `DBT_BIGQUERY_TARGET_DATASET` if the former is missing.





## Serious SQL

Alright, in module 1, you had a SQL refresher, so now let's build on top of that with some serious SQL.

These are not meant to be easy - but they'll boost your SQL and Analytics skills to the next level.  
So, without any further do, let's get started...

You might want to add some new dimensions `year` (e.g.: 2019, 2020), `quarter` (1, 2, 3, 4), `year_quarter` (e.g.: `2019/Q1`, `2019-Q2`), and `month` (e.g.: 1, 2, ..., 12), **extracted from pickup_datetime**, to your `fct_taxi_trips` OR `dim_taxi_trips.sql` models to facilitate filtering your queries


### Question 5: Taxi Quarterly Revenue Growth

1. Create a new model `fct_taxi_trips_quarterly_revenue.sql`
2. Compute the Quarterly Revenues for each year for based on `total_amount`
3. Compute the Quarterly YoY (Year-over-Year) revenue growth 
  * e.g.: In 2020/Q1, Green Taxi had -12.34% revenue growth compared to 2019/Q1
  * e.g.: In 2020/Q4, Yellow Taxi had +34.56% revenue growth compared to 2019/Q4

Considering the YoY Growth in 2020, which were the yearly quarters with the best (or less worse) and worst results for green, and yellow

- green: {best: 2020/Q2, worst: 2020/Q1}, yellow: {best: 2020/Q2, worst: 2020/Q1}
- green: {best: 2020/Q2, worst: 2020/Q1}, yellow: {best: 2020/Q3, worst: 2020/Q4}
- green: {best: 2020/Q1, worst: 2020/Q2}, yellow: {best: 2020/Q2, worst: 2020/Q1}
- **green: {best: 2020/Q1, worst: 2020/Q2}, yellow: {best: 2020/Q1, worst: 2020/Q2}**
- green: {best: 2020/Q1, worst: 2020/Q2}, yellow: {best: 2020/Q3, worst: 2020/Q4}


#### Answer :
green: {best: 2020/Q1, worst: 2020/Q2}, yellow: {best: 2020/Q1, worst: 2020/Q2}

For green, the best YoY was -56.41% in 2020 Q1 and worst was -92.82% in 2020 Q2. For yellow, the best YoY was -19.93% in 2020 Q1 and worst was -92.57% in 2020 Q2.


### Question 6: P97/P95/P90 Taxi Monthly Fare

1. Create a new model `fct_taxi_trips_monthly_fare_p95.sql`
2. Filter out invalid entries (`fare_amount > 0`, `trip_distance > 0`, and `payment_type_description in ('Cash', 'Credit Card')`)
3. Compute the **continous percentile** of `fare_amount` partitioning by service_type, year and and month

Now, what are the values of `p97`, `p95`, `p90` for Green Taxi and Yellow Taxi, in April 2020?

- green: {p97: 55.0, p95: 45.0, p90: 26.5}, yellow: {p97: 52.0, p95: 37.0, p90: 25.5}
- **green: {p97: 55.0, p95: 45.0, p90: 26.5}, yellow: {p97: 31.5, p95: 25.5, p90: 19.0}**
- green: {p97: 40.0, p95: 33.0, p90: 24.5}, yellow: {p97: 52.0, p95: 37.0, p90: 25.5}
- green: {p97: 40.0, p95: 33.0, p90: 24.5}, yellow: {p97: 31.5, p95: 25.5, p90: 19.0}
- green: {p97: 55.0, p95: 45.0, p90: 26.5}, yellow: {p97: 52.0, p95: 25.5, p90: 19.0}

#### Answer :
green: {p97: 55.0, p95: 45.0, p90: 26.5}, yellow: {p97: 31.5, p95: 25.5, p90: 19.0}



### Question 7: Top #Nth longest P90 travel time Location for FHV

Prerequisites:
* Create a staging model for FHV Data (2019), and **DO NOT** add a deduplication step, just filter out the entries where `where dispatching_base_num is not null`
* Create a core model for FHV Data (`dim_fhv_trips.sql`) joining with `dim_zones`. Similar to what has been done [here](../../../04-analytics-engineering/taxi_rides_ny/models/core/fact_trips.sql)
* Add some new dimensions `year` (e.g.: 2019) and `month` (e.g.: 1, 2, ..., 12), based on `pickup_datetime`, to the core model to facilitate filtering for your queries

Now...
1. Create a new model `fct_fhv_monthly_zone_traveltime_p90.sql`
2. For each record in `dim_fhv_trips.sql`, compute the [timestamp_diff](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/timestamp_functions#timestamp_diff) in seconds between dropoff_datetime and pickup_datetime - we'll call it `trip_duration` for this exercise
3. Compute the **continous** `p90` of `trip_duration` partitioning by year, month, pickup_location_id, and dropoff_location_id

For the Trips that **respectively** started from `Newark Airport`, `SoHo`, and `Yorkville East`, in November 2019, what are **dropoff_zones** with the 2nd longest p90 trip_duration ?

- **LaGuardia Airport, Chinatown, Garment District**
- LaGuardia Airport, Park Slope, Clinton East
- LaGuardia Airport, Saint Albans, Howard Beach
- LaGuardia Airport, Rosedale, Bath Beach
- LaGuardia Airport, Yorkville East, Greenpoint

#### Answer :
The second p90 dropoff zones respectively are: LaGuardia Airport, Chinatown, Garment District
